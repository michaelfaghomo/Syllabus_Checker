# Test Samples Directory

## Purpose
This directory is for storing sample syllabus PDFs that you want to use for testing and improving the detection algorithm.

## How to Add Test Syllabi

### Option 1: Direct Upload
1. Place your PDF, DOCX, or TXT syllabus files in this directory
2. The files will be available for reference and testing

### Option 2: Via Web Interface (Coming Soon)
A test interface will allow you to upload and test syllabi with detailed debugging information.

## Recommended Test Files

For best algorithm improvement, include syllabi that:
1. Have different formats/layouts
2. May be missing clear section headers
3. Have links embedded in different ways
4. Use various VCU building names or locations
5. Have prerequisites stated in different ways
